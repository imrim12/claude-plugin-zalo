# Zalo Claude Plugin — Agent Context

## What this is

An MCP plugin (stdio transport) that bridges Zalo personal-account messaging into Claude Code.
**Two processes, one DB.** A single always-on **daemon** (`src/daemon.ts`) owns the Zalo
WebSocket and a SQLite log (`messages.db`); each Claude session runs a thin **proxy**
(`src/proxy.ts`, launched by `server.ts`) that talks to the daemon *only through the shared
SQLite DB* (no socket). The daemon gates + writes every inbound message to SQLite; a live proxy
atomically claims the messages that should be answered, enriches them with prior context, and
delivers them as `notifications/claude/channel` events (rendered as `<channel source="zalo"
...>`). Claude replies with the `reply` tool → an `outbound` queue row → the daemon sends it.
Replies go out under the user's own personal account — this is not a bot.

Only DMs and group @mentions wake the LLM; unmentioned group messages are logged to SQLite
silently (no notification). The daemon is spawn-on-demand (a detached background process the
first session launches; no scheduled task, no console window, nothing installed on the system),
so opening/closing sessions never drops the connection, and N sessions coexist with exactly one
answering each message (atomic row-claim).

Access control is pairing-code based: strangers get a code, the user approves with
`/zalo:access pair <code>` — all state in `~/.claude/channels/zalo/access.json` (account-global),
managed by skills editing JSON directly (no MCP tools mutate access).

## Distribution

Distributed as a Claude Code plugin via the `imrim12` marketplace (also published to npm as
`claude-plugin-zalo`). The plugin's `.mcp.json` launches the server from the plugin's own
installed checkout — `bun run --cwd ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT} --shell=bun --silent start` (the same
run model as the official Telegram channel plugin). `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` is the plugin's
install dir (the marketplace cache for an installed plugin, or the repo root under
`--plugin-dir`); Claude Code installs plugin deps into that dir at install time, so the cached
checkout has its own `node_modules`. `--silent` is mandatory: without it `bun run` prints
`$ bun server.ts` to stdout and corrupts the MCP transport. `--shell=bun` keeps the `start`
script cross-platform on Windows. The `start` script is `bun server.ts` (which launches the proxy); `bin` is also
`./server.ts` for the npm/`bunx` path. Both proxy and daemon are cwd-independent (all state
resolves from `homedir()`), so `--cwd ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` only anchors `bun run` to the right
`package.json`. `.npmignore` keeps the tarball to `src/`, `server.ts`, `skills/`, `hooks/`,
`.claude-plugin/`, `.mcp.json`, `README.md`, `LICENSE`, `package.json` — dev tooling
(`.agents/`, `.claude/`, `tests/`, configs, lockfiles, `CLAUDE.md`) is excluded. The optional
PostToolUse hook is loaded automatically from the standard `hooks/hooks.json` path — do NOT add a
`"hooks"` key to `plugin.json` (Claude Code auto-loads the standard file, so a manifest reference
double-loads it and fails with a "Duplicate hooks file detected" error). Keep `package.json`
and `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` versions in lockstep when publishing.

## Local development (running against this repo)

To run the channel from the working tree instead of the installed `zalo@imrim12`, launch Claude
Code from the repo with `--plugin-dir .`:

```
claude --plugin-dir . --dangerously-load-development-channels plugin:zalo
```

`--plugin-dir .` loads this repo as a plugin named `zalo` and **shadows the installed
`zalo@imrim12` for that session** (same name → local wins), so only one instance runs — no
fight over the single Zalo account/listener slot. Because `.mcp.json` runs
`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/start` and `CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT` is now the repo, this executes the live
local `server.ts`. Note the channel ref is **`plugin:zalo`** (no `@imrim12` suffix) — a
`--plugin-dir` plugin has no marketplace. In other projects, omit `--plugin-dir` and the
installed `zalo@imrim12` runs its cached stock copy as usual.

The repo's `.mcp.json` is ALSO auto-discovered by Claude Code as a project-scoped MCP server
named `zalo` — but a project server is not a plugin and can never deliver channel
notifications (inbound is plugin-gated), and it would collide with the `--plugin-dir` plugin
over the account slot. It is therefore disabled in `.claude/settings.local.json`
(`disabledMcpjsonServers: ["zalo"]`). Leave it disabled; use `--plugin-dir` for development.

## Inbound delivery requires a client-side flag

Claude Code only renders channel notifications from plugins on Anthropic's approved channels
allowlist (a remotely-served ledger). This plugin is not on it. Sessions must be launched with:

```
claude --dangerously-load-development-channels plugin:zalo@imrim12
```

(When developing against this repo with `--plugin-dir .`, the ref is `plugin:zalo` instead —
see **Local development** below.) Without the flag the client silently drops inbound
notifications — the gate, typing indicator, and outbound tools all still work, which makes the
failure look like a server bug. Diagnose via the client log line `Channel notifications
skipped: plugin zalo@imrim12 is not on the approved channels allowlist` in
`%LOCALAPPDATA%\claude-cli-nodejs\Cache\<project>\mcp-logs-plugin-zalo-zalo\`.

## How to run and verify

```sh
bun server.ts        # the proxy — stays open, speaks MCP over stdio
bun src/daemon.ts    # the daemon — owns Zalo + SQLite (pnpm daemon)

pnpm typecheck   # must exit 0
pnpm lint        # oxlint --deny-warnings; must exit 0
bun test         # db + lock unit tests, proxy protocol, daemon integration (ZALO_FAKE)
```

`tools/list` returns exactly 4 tools. `tests/setup.ts` sets `ZALO_STATE_DIR` to a temp dir
(collapsing every path under it) and `ZALO_NO_DAEMON_SPAWN=1` so a spawned proxy never forks a
real detached daemon that would outlive the test and hold the temp `messages.db` open (breaking
cleanup on Windows). Test spawns pass `env: {...process.env}` explicitly — on Windows a spawned
child inherits the original environment block, not `process.env` mutations, so without the
pass-through a test process would run against the real `~/.claude` DB. `tests/daemon.test.ts`
runs a real daemon with a fake Zalo API (`ZALO_FAKE=1`, fed inbound via `fake-inbound.jsonl`)
against its OWN temp dir so its on-disk lock/DB don't collide with the unit tests. Never spawn
the daemon against the real state dir while a session is live (it would fight for the account).

## Source layout

`src/` is layered so a second channel (`channels/oa`, coming soon) can reuse everything
outside `channels/`. Dependency direction is one-way: `constants → utils → core → channels →
handlers → {daemon, proxy}`. `core/` never imports a channel; channel-specific message shapes
(zca-js `Message`/`TMessage`, `Reactions`) stay inside `channels/user/`.

**Naming convention.** **Persistence entities** (`messages`, `outbound`, `perm_*`, `meta`,
`access`, `credentials`, the daemon `lock`) expose `<entity><Verb>` functions using CRUD verbs:
`create / get / list / update / delete` — e.g. `messageCreate`, `outboundUpdate`, `metaGet`,
`accessGet`, `lockCreate`. A non-CRUD persistence action keeps a named verb only when a CRUD verb
would mislead or collide (today the one exception is `messageClaim` — the atomic
`UPDATE…RETURNING` that IS the exactly-once delivery invariant, not a plain update).
**Non-entity modules** (session lifecycle, request handlers, daemon glue, context assembly) use
`<module><DescriptiveVerb>` — e.g. `sessionLogin`, `toolsRegister`, `inboundPoll`, `contextBuild`,
`daemonEnsure`. Connection/retention infra in `db/client.ts` (`db()`, `dbPrune`, the query
helpers) owns no single entity and is exempt.

| File | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| `server.ts` | Entry shim — imports `src/proxy.ts`. Kept at root so `.mcp.json`, `pnpm start`, and tests keep spawning `bun server.ts`. |
| `src/proxy.ts` | **The per-session proxy.** MCP connect + lifecycle; opens the shared DB; starts the inbound poller + permission poller; `daemonEnsure()`. Dies with its session — no Zalo state to release. |
| `src/daemon.ts` | **The always-on daemon.** Acquires the single-instance lock, opens DB, injects `ingest` into the session, cookie-login, heartbeat/health, outbound drain loop, retention. NOT unref'd (must block exit). |
| **`src/constants/`** | |
| `constants/paths.ts` | Account-global path constants (`HOME_STATE_DIR`, `DB_FILE`, `LOCK_FILE`, `DAEMON_LOG`, `ACCESS_FILE`, `INBOX_DIR`); `MEMORY_DIR` (project-local, for context enrichment); `STATIC` flag; mkdir side effect. |
| **`src/utils/`** | Channel-agnostic pure helpers. `log.ts` (stderr only), `chunk.ts` (outbound text chunking). |
| **`src/core/`** | Channel-agnostic. No imports from `channels/`. |
| **`src/core/db/`** | **The SQLite bus**, split per persistence entity. Consumers import from the `index.ts` barrel; the entity files import helpers from `./client.ts`. |
| `core/db/client.ts` | Connection (WAL + busy_timeout + quick_check/quarantine), schema/migrations, shared query helpers (`allRows`/`getRow`/`run`/`runReturningId`), row types (`InsertMessage`/`MessageRow`/`OutboundRow`), whole-DB retention `dbPrune`. Exempt from the noun-CRUD convention. |
| `core/db/message.ts` | `messages` adapter: `messageCreate`, atomic `messageClaim` (UPDATE…RETURNING), `messageList`, `messageGet`, `messageUpdate`. |
| `core/db/outbound.ts` | `outbound` queue adapter: `outboundCreate`, `outboundList`, `outboundUpdate` (watermark-tx), `outboundGet`. |
| `core/db/perm.ts` | permission relay adapter: `permRequestCreate`, `permResponseCreate`, `permResponseList` (consume-on-read). |
| `core/db/meta.ts` | `meta` kv adapter: `metaUpdate` (upsert), `metaGet`. |
| `core/db/index.ts` | Public barrel re-exporting `db`, `dbPrune`, the row types, and every entity function. |
| `core/lock.ts` | Daemon single-instance lock (`openSync 'wx'` + PID-liveness reclaim) — `lockCreate`/`lockDelete`. |
| `core/context.ts` | `contextBuild()` — the "previous chat" block: unprocessed rows + a memory snippet, prefixed to the trigger message; returns the watermark id. |
| `core/daemon-ensure.ts` | Heartbeat-based liveness → spawn the detached daemon on demand (`daemonEnsure`, `spawnDaemon`, `windowsHide`, stdio→`daemon.log`). The ONLY daemon-start path — there is no Scheduled Task. `ZALO_NO_DAEMON_SPAWN=1` disables spawn (tests). |
| `core/mcp.ts` | The `Server` instance: capabilities + model-facing instructions. |
| `core/access.ts` | `Access` types, `access.json` read/write (`accessGet`/`accessUpdate`, account-global), static-mode snapshot, `accessAssertAllowed` outbound gate. |
| **`src/handlers/`** | |
| `handlers/inbound-poller.ts` | Proxy: `messageClaim` → `contextBuild` → `notifications/claude/channel`. |
| `handlers/tools.ts` | `toolsRegister()` — the 4 tools; each gates then enqueues an `outbound` row (`outboundCreate`) and polls `outboundGet` for the result. |
| `handlers/permissions.ts` | Proxy: `permission_request` → `permRequestCreate` + enqueue `permission_dm`; poll `perm_responses` (`permResponseList`) for THIS session's requests → emit `permission`. |
| **`src/channels/user/`** | Zalo **personal** account transport (zca-js). Owns all zca-specific types. |
| `channels/user/daemon-runtime.ts` | Daemon glue: `ingest` (self-filter → gate → permission-reply intercept → write `messages` row, quote_json + attachments), `drainOutbound`/`execOutbound` (reply/react/download/login/permission_dm), `buildQuote`. |
| `channels/user/session.ts` | Zalo client + `api`/`ownId`/`kicked` state, `wireApi`, cookie-relogin backoff, QR login, `sessionState`, `ZALO_FAKE` stub. Inbound handler injected by the daemon. |
| `channels/user/gate.ts` | The fail-secure `gate()`: pairing codes, allowlist, group + mention policy. |
| `channels/user/attachments.ts` | Attachment kind/href/title/params mapping, `attachmentDownload` (cookies+UA, 50MB, decrypt hook), `attachmentPrune`, `attachmentExt`, `messageText`, `safeName`. |
| `channels/user/credentials.ts` | `credentials.json` load/save (atomic, 0o600, re-persisted every login). |
| `channels/user/reactions.ts` | Emoji → zca `Reactions` code mapping. |
| `channels/user/approvals.ts` | `approved/<senderId>` polling → "Paired!" DM (runs in the daemon). |
| `hooks/` | Optional PostToolUse hook (`mark-processed.ts` + `hooks.json`) — belt-and-suspenders watermark mark-processed. |
| **`src/channels/oa/`** | Zalo **Official Account** transport — coming soon (see `README.md`). |
| `skills/` | auth, configure, access, status, uninstall SKILL.md docs (the five skills listed in plugin.json). `uninstall` is the full teardown: stops the daemon (PID from `daemon.lock`), wipes `HOME_STATE_DIR` + memory, removes any leftover `ClaudeZaloDaemon` Scheduled Task from older versions, then defers plugin removal to `/plugin`. |

## State files

**Everything is account-global** at `~/.claude/channels/zalo` (`HOME_STATE_DIR`) — the daemon
serves every project, so there is no per-project state dir anymore. `ZALO_STATE_DIR` overrides
the root and collapses every path under it (keeps tests off the real home dir). `MEMORY_DIR`
(project-local `.claude/memory/zalo`, resolved from `CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR`) is the ONE remaining
project-local path — `context.ts` reads the handling session's summarized notes from there for
context enrichment. Writes are atomic (tmp+rename), mode `0o600`.

- `credentials.json` — `{ imei, userAgent, cookie, language? }`, re-persisted after every login (Zalo rotates cookies)
- `qr-login.png` — QR login image
- `messages.db` — canonical SQLite log of every inbound message + the daemon↔proxy IPC bus (WAL). Tables: `messages`, `outbound`, `perm_requests`, `perm_responses`, `meta`. The DB replaces the old markdown transcript.
- `access.json` — `{ dmPolicy, allowFrom, groups, pending, mentionPatterns?, ackReaction?, replyToMode?, textChunkLimit?, chunkMode? }`. Each `groups[id]` is `{ requireMention, allowFrom, observe? }` — `observe:false` mutes a group persistently.
- `daemon.lock` — single-instance lock (PID + liveness reclaim); `daemon.log` — the detached daemon's log
- `approved/<senderId>` — touch-files from `/zalo:access pair`; the daemon polls every 5s, confirms with a "Paired!" DM, removes
- `inbox/` — downloaded attachment bytes; `attachmentPrune` age- + size-caps it (14d / 500MB)
- Claude's summarized secretary notes live in `MEMORY_DIR/zalo/<chat_id>.md` (project-local) — the summarized half; `messages.db` is the complete raw record.

## MCP tools (4)

All gate via `accessAssertAllowed` in the proxy, then enqueue an `outbound` row (`outboundCreate`)
the daemon drains and poll `outboundGet` for the result (a poll timeout means the daemon is down → `/zalo:status`).

| Tool | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `reply` | Reply to inbound messages. Chunks at ~2000 chars; optional quote via `reply_to` (reconstructed from the DB `quote_json`, survives restart); echoes `watermark_id` to mark-processed |
| `react` | Reaction on any message the daemon has seen (resolved from the DB, not a session cache — survives restart) |
| `download_attachment` | Fetch a message's CDN attachment to `inbox/` (50MB cap); resolved from the DB row, source chat must still be allowlisted; result `local_path` persisted so a re-download is a no-op |
| `zalo_login` | QR login; writes `qr-login.png`, resolves with the path while login continues in background (the daemon runs the actual login) |

## Key invariants

- **The gate is fail-secure for DMs.** `disabled` drops everything; `allowlist` requires an
  explicit `allowFrom` entry; `pairing` never grants access without terminal approval. Never
  weaken the DM paths.
- **The daemon is the only Zalo sender and the only inbound `messages` writer.** Proxies read
  freely (WAL) and write `outbound`/`perm_*` rows; SQLite serializes writers via `busy_timeout`.
- **Atomic `messageClaim` (UPDATE…RETURNING) is the exactly-once guarantee** — two proxies
  polling concurrently get disjoint row sets. Never add an owner-election / broadcast path.
- **Mark-processed is watermark-scoped** (`WHERE id <= watermark`), in the SAME transaction as
  the outbound status flip — never an open-ended `WHERE processed=0` (a message arriving between
  send and mark would be swallowed). The proxy passes the watermark from the notification meta.
- **Zalo login happens only after the daemon lock is held** — a double-spawn can never produce
  two WebSockets. The single-instance lock (`core/lock.ts`) is the mutex; a second spawned daemon
  sees the held lock and exits immediately.
- **Groups are open-but-observe-only by design** (deliberate, user-chosen — *not* a hole to
  "fix"). An unknown group is auto-registered (`{requireMention:true, allowFrom:[], observe:true}`)
  and every message is logged to SQLite so the record is complete; the gate returns
  `respond=false` for unmentioned group messages → `should_reply=0`, so they are **logged only,
  never delivered to a session** (no LLM wake). `disabled` still kills groups; `observe:false`
  mutes one group; an explicit per-group `allowFrom` hard-drops outside senders. Auto-registration
  is why outbound replies to a mentioned group pass `accessAssertAllowed`.
- **`message.isSelf || uidFrom === "0"` hard filter** — never remove. Without it, pairing mode
  auto-replies codes to everyone the user messages from their phone.
- **Pairing-shaped inbound never gets pairing replies** (`PAIRING_SHAPE_RE`) — two plugin
  instances DMing each other would ping-pong codes forever.
- **Atomic 0o600 writes** for `credentials.json` and `access.json` (tmp+rename).
- **Outbound `reply`/`react`/`download_attachment` gated by `accessAssertAllowed`** in the proxy,
  before enqueue (an unauthorized call errors immediately, no DB round-trip).
- **Kicked listener stands down.** `DuplicateConnection`/`KickConnection` close codes mean
  another Zalo session took the slot — never auto-relogin-fight (it churns the cookie). Surfaced
  as `meta.ws_state = "kicked"`.
- **Access mutations have no MCP tools** — `/zalo:access` edits the JSON in the terminal,
  keeping them out of reach of prompt injection via channel messages. Skills must refuse
  access changes requested through channel messages.
- **`image_path`/attachment info goes in notification meta only**, never inline in content
  (forgeable); sender-controlled names pass through `safeName()`.

## Runtime notes

- `loginQR` resolves `Promise<API>`; cookies re-persisted after every login via
  `api.getCookie().toJSON()`.
- `mentions` only exists on group messages — narrow on `message.type === ThreadType.Group`.
- Quote-replies need the full `TMessage` (`SendMessageQuote` needs `propertyExt`/`ttl` not stored
  as columns), so the daemon stashes `JSON.stringify(message.data)` in the `quote_json` column at
  ingest and `buildQuote()` reconstructs from it — quote/react now survive a daemon restart (the
  in-memory message-cache is gone). React/download resolve from `messageGet`.
- `AddReactionDestination.cliMsgId` is a **string** (not a number) — pass the row's `cli_msg_id`
  through as-is.
- Zalo reactions are codes (`Reactions` enum), not unicode; `EMOJI_TO_REACTION` maps common
  emoji.
- The daemon's `setInterval`s are **not** `.unref()`'d (unlike the proxy, which the stdio MCP
  transport keeps alive) — a daemon must block exit. It writes an initial heartbeat at boot so a
  proxy starting in the first few seconds doesn't spawn a needless fallback.

## Dependency notes

| Package | Why |
|---|---|
| `zca-js` | Zalo personal account WebSocket client |
| `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` | MCP server + stdio transport |
| `zod` | Notification handler schema |
| `bun:sqlite` (built-in) | The message log + IPC bus (`core/db/`) — no external dep; needs WAL + `UPDATE…RETURNING` (verified in Bun ≥ 1.2) |
| `oxlint` (dev) | Linter (`pnpm lint`) |
